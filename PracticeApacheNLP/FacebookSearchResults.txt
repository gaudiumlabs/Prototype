On this day, many years ago, Greece was liberated from the 500 years of Turkish occupation.  Today, there will be countless Greeks partying ( OPA! ) to celebrate the freedom of their country, known as Greek Independence Day!  So Happy Greek Independence Day to all our fellow Greeks, and Happy Hump Day to all!  #GreekIndependanceDay #EatGreekFood
